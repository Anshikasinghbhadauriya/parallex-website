      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        The importance of the nature of goods is highlighted and the risk considerations of those which are new to market, perishable, branded, licensed, promotional, and dual-use. 
        The need to assess the marketability, price volatility, and net realisable value of the goods after the costs of disposal is explained.The most important contribution of nature
        to human life is, of course, food. It would be impossible to continue to survive on the planet if we did not get nutrition from the planet itself. Imagine if there was no nature
        around us.That would mean no crops would grow, no animals would roam, and no trees would be there to bear fruits and flowers. The seas, rivers, and ponds would not be there either
        to provide us with water.There would be literally nothing to eat or drink. Since prehistoric times, man has secured from nature; initially by hunting animals and gathering fruits,
        then graduating to growing crops, and finally transitioning to our modern kitchens. Today, we can cook delicious dishes and drink purified water, but none of that would be possible
        had not nature provided us with the raw ingredients.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        Nature heals.just a walk in the woods or a stroll by the beach on a sunny morning can awaken the innermost feelings of happiness and peace, and Environmental Psychology has gone a long
        way proving this fact (Bell, Greene, Fisher, & Baum, 1996).Our affinity toward nature is genetic and deep-rooted in evolution. For example, have you ever wondered why most people prefer
        to book accommodations that have a great view from the balcony or the terrace? Why patients who get a natural view from their hospital bed recover sooner than others.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        Nature is an inspiration source for human being. Albert Einstein once said: "We know less than one thousandth of one percent of what nature has to reveal to us." Nature gives us the showers
        that clears our mind and clean our thinking.While society means many things deal with busy life, a chaos, competition, anger, sadness, disappointment; nature, however can present happiness, 
        equality, brevity, encouragement, peace, dignity, hope and honour
